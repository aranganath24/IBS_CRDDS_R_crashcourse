# where exports are 133, and imports are 55

# and imports are 55; reverses order in which inputs are supplied but function 
# returns the same value because of the labels

# tests the "net_exports_calculation" function in a case where exports are 55, 
# and imports are 133; does not explicitly label inputs, order matters

# creates a new function that takes consumption spending, government spending,

# tests gdp calculation for consumption spending of 125, 
# government spending of 66, investment spending of 36, and net exports of -33

# creates a function that takes a temperature value ("value"), 
# and a temperature scale label ("unit") that is either "Fahrenheit" or 
# "Celsius" which designates the temperature scale of the input temperature 
# value; if the input argument is in "Fahrenheit", the function converts the 
# temperature to Celsius and returns this value; if the input is in "Celsius" 
# the function converts the temperature to Fahrenheit and returns this value; 
# if the the temperature scale label is neither "Fahrenheit" nor "Celsius" 
# an error message is returned to the user; the function is assigned to 
# a new object named "convert_temperature"

# Converts 100 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius

# Converts 25 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit

# Attempts to convert 100 degrees Kelvin to another unit; 
# met with a message specifying the function's limitations

# creates a vector of fahrenheit inputs to iterate over

# iteratively applies the "fahrenheit_to_celsius_converter" function 
# to the vector of input arguments, "fahrenheit_input_vector", and

# creates a data frame in which one column contains 
# Fahrenheit input values, and the other contains Celsius output values

# prints contents of "fahrenheit_celsius_df_output"

# creates export and import vectors

# iteratively applies the "net_exports_calculation" 
# function to the export values contained in "export_vector"

# creates data frame with exports in first column, 
# imports in second column, and net exports in third; 
# assigns the data frame to a new object named "net_exports_dataframe"

# alternative way of creating "net_exports_dataframe"

# creates a list as a container for the input arguments we'll 
# iteratively run through the "gdp_calculation" function

# iteratively passes arguments from "gdp_input_list" to the
# "gdp_calculation" function and deposits the results in a 
# new list object named "gdp_output_list"

# prints contents of "gdp_output_list"

# iteratively passes arguments from "gdp_input_list" to the 
# "gdp_calculation" function and deposits the results in a

# creates new function to take a country name,

# and return a data frame with the country name, temperature 
# value in Fahrenheit, and Temperature value in Celsius as columns;
# the function is assigned to a new object named "convert_temperature_df"

# tests "convert_temperature_df" function for USA as the country
# input, and a temperature of 100 degrees in Fahrenheit

# tests "convert_temperature_df" function for India as 
# the country input, and a temperature of 100 degrees in Fahrenheit

# creates a list of inputs to iterate over

# iteratively applies the "convert_temperature_df" function

# prints contents of "convert_temperature_list"

# appends together the single-row data frames in "convert_temperature_list"

# Writes a function that takes a vector of fahrenheit temperature

# define a variable in the global environment

# creates a toy function that takes a numeric input argument ("input1"); it defines 
# an object, x, within the function, then defines a function, z, that's the 
# sum of x and input1. It returns Z as an output

# passes the argument "input1=7" to the toy function

# prints value of x; note it returns the value from the global environment

# prints value of z; note that there's an error, since z is only defined 
# within the local environment of the function

# prints objects in memory; note that z is not included, since it's
